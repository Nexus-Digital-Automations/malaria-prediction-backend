   - Scheduler integration
   - Old file cleanup

4. **CLI Integration**
   - `ingest-data` command with ERA5 support
   - `era5-setup` command for automation
   - `era5-validate` command for file validation

### Technical Debt

- Need to handle different ERA5 data products (pressure levels, land data)
- Should add support for additional variables (humidity, wind, etc.)
- Consider implementing parallel downloads for efficiency

### Dependencies

- âœ… cdsapi (installed)
- âœ… xarray (installed)
- âœ… netCDF4 (installed)
- âœ… schedule (installed)

### Success Criteria

- [x] Temperature data downloads for Africa region
- [x] Data validation confirms file integrity
- [x] Automated updates run on schedule
- [x] CLI commands work as expected
- [ ] Data is stored in database
- [ ] API endpoints serve ERA5 data
- [ ] System processes data efficiently
